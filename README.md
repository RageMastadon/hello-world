# hello-world
Looking for the edges of the virtual world. 
I am Zygon, Captain of the underground cyborg nation and I'm searching for the ends of internet/virtual reality/augmented relaity/and why teemo was ever created. I understand it's a dangerous and vicious frontier but if not me and my cyborg nation of Kahzulla then who else?
